    Think of the console like the dashboard in your car. Just like you can see your speed, fuel level,
    and other important information on your car's dashboard, the console in programming provides you with real-time
    text-based output for what your code is doing.

    Here's a breakdown of what the console is and its functions:

    1. Display Output: When you print something in your code, it shows up in the console. If your program
    calculates the sum of two numbers, for example, you can display that sum in the console. It's like the
    speedometer telling you how fast you're going.

    2. Receive Input: You can also use the console to input data into your program. If your program needs two
    numbers to add together, you can type those numbers into the console. It's like adjusting the temperature
    or radio station in your car using the dashboard controls.

    3. Debugging: When you're troubleshooting your code (akin to figuring out what that weird noise in your car is),
    you often use the console to print out variables or messages. This can help you understand what your
    code is doing at different stages, just like how warning lights on your dashboard alert you to potential
    problems.

    4. Command Execution: In some development environments, the console can also be used to run specific commands.
    For example, you might use it to compile your Java code into bytecode. It's like pressing a button on your
    dashboard to check tire pressure or other vehicle diagnostics.

    5. Real-Time Feedback: The console provides immediate, real-time feedback. As soon as your code executes a
    print statement, you'll see it in the console. It's as instant as seeing your speed increase on the speedometer
    when you step on the gas pedal.
