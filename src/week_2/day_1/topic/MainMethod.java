     The main method!

     Think of it like the ignition key of a car. Just like turning the key starts the
     engine and sets the car in motion, the main method is the starting point for any standalone Java program.
     When you run your Java program, the code inside the main method is what gets executed first.

    Here's how the main method works in a Java program:

    Entry Point: Just like you need to turn the key to start your car, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) needs
    an entry point to start running your program. The main method serves as that entry point.

    Syntax: The main method has a very specific signature in Java. It's usually written as
    public static void main(String[] args). This is like the specific shape and size of the ignition keyhole;
    it has to be this way for the JVM to recognize it.

    1. Public: The public keyword means that the main method is accessible from anywhere.
    It's like how the ignition is usually accessible to anyone sitting in the driver's seat.

    2. Static: Static means that the method belongs to the class itself, rather than any particular
    object instance of the class. You don't need to create an object of the class to start the main method,
    just like you don't need to build a car from scratch every time you want to drive; you just need the key
    to an existing car.

    3. Void: The void keyword means that the main method doesn't return any value. Starting the car
    doesn't "give you back" anything; it just sets the process in motion.

    4. String[] args: This is an array of Strings that you can pass when you run your program. Imagine
    if your car's ignition also asked you for the destination or other settings each time you started the car;
     that's what these arguments are like. However, they're optional.

    First to Run: As soon as you start your Java program, the main method is the first thing that runs.
    It's like how turning the key is the first step in driving your car.

    So, whenever you're looking at a Java program, look for the main method. That's where the action starts,
    and it gives you a roadmap for understanding what the program is designed to do. Just like a car won't run
    without turning the key, a standalone Java program won't run without a main method.
