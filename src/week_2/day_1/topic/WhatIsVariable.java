/*
    Variables in Java are like containers or boxes where you can store information. Imagine you're moving to
    a new house. You'd use boxes to pack different types of items: books, dishes, clothes, etc.
    You might even label these boxes so that you know what's inside each one without having to open it up.

    In Java, each variable is like one of those labeled boxes.
