    Types of Variables

    1. Local Variables: These are like boxes you only use in one room (within a method) and aren't available
    elsewhere.

    2. Instance Variables: Imagine a box that belongs to the entire house and can be accessed from
    any room. These variables belong to an object and are available to all methods within the same
    class, as long as they are called on the same object.

    3. Class Variables: Also known as static variables, these are like community boxes that are shared among
    all instances (objects) of a class.
