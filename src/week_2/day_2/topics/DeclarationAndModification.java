    /*

    Once you've declared a variable, you can put data in it (this is called "initializing" the variable),
     and you can change that data later on:

    int age;      // Declare
    age = 30;     // Initialize
    age = 35;     // Modify

    Declaration + Initialization at the same line
    int age = 30; --> int age --> Declare | age = 30 ---> Initialize
    age = 50; --> Modification


    Or you can do it all at once:

    int age = 30; // Declare and Initialize


    public class VariableExample {

        public static void main(String[] args) {

            // Local variable
            int score = 100;

            // Using the variable
            System.out.println(score);

            // Modifying the variable
            score = 150;
            System.out.println(score);
        }
    }

    Think of variables as your way to keep track of information that you can use and manipulate throughout
    your program, much like how you'd use boxes to organize and store various items in real life.
